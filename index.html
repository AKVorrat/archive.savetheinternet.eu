				<h3>Internet wins</h3>
				<p>This summer, hundreds of thousands of Internet users banded together to keep the Internet open and free. Together, we sent a loud, clear message to BEREC, the Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications: protect net neutrality.</p>
				<p>And it worked! BEREC’s final guidelines, which were published on 30 August 2016, offer some of the strongest net neutrality protections we could wish for. As long as these new rules are properly enforced by national telecom regulators, they represent a resounding victory for net neutrality.</p>
				<p>The public has made it clear that it will not let the future of its digital public space be decided by big telco lobbyists. The public wants to decide that future for itself. To this end, civil society must remain watchful, to ensure that telecom operators don’t violate the new principles.</p>
				<p>The consultation came as the final step of a legislative process that was launched in September 2013. In the three years that followed, the SaveTheInternet.eu coalition campaigned successfully for the Regulation on which the consultation is based.</p>
				<p>SaveTheInternet.eu wants to thank everyone who participated in this outstanding effort to protect the free, open Internet! Thank you!</p>

					<em>November 2014 - January 2015</em>
					<p>After the European Parliament adopted its position, it was the turn of the 28 EU Member States of the European Union (EU) had to negotiate their position. It is always very hard for public interests groups to influence this stage of the legislative process. Usually unknown negotiators appointed by governments the relevant ministries meet in secret without keeping track of official documentation. Yet, Still this iteration of the campaign we tried to inform the public about what is happening and offered them the possibility to send e-mails to the permanent representation (which is basically like an embassy to the EU) of their country in Brussels. The text that was adopted by the 28 EU member states was better than the Commission's proposal but much worse than the position of the European Parliament. After this stage, the three institutions had to reach a common agreement within the so-called <a href="https://edri.org/files/NN_process_infographics.pdf">'trilogues'</a>.</p>

Their EU umbrella organisation The EU telecom regulators gathered within the Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communication (BEREC) was tasked to write Guidelines for the unified EU harmonising wide the implementation and enforcement of the net neutrality Regulation. These guidelines would determine how national telecom regulators executed the law and what would soon be seen as a net neutrality violation or a legitimate practice. For this step, the campaign offered citizens could to write their opinion on net neutrality in the form of a questionnaire and send it to their regulator. This was acompanied by an <a href="https://edri.org/edris-first-input-on-net-neutrality-guidelines/">in-depth analysis of the legislation</a> that showed how to deliver real net neutrality within the letter of the law, meetings with many regulators, a professional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv3DeyqZzOg">explanatory video</a> and a <a href="http://www.apa-fotoservice.at/galerie/7863">demonstration in Vienna</a> and a <a href="https://xnet-x.net/por-que-importante-neutralidad-de-la-red/" target="_blank">mapping action in Barcelona</a> around the plenary meeting where the draft guidelines text was decided.</p>
